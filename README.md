# Project Code Diva

### Objective
Not ready yet.

### Time Line
* 08 Sept :: Collect test code files.  
* 08 Sept :: Evaluate whether Java is, in fact, feasible to do this in.
* 15 Sept :: Get a code skeleton in place with stubs.
* 22 Sept :: Flesh out the stubs in the skeleton
* 26 Sept :: Debug the whole mess.   
* **26 Sept :: Overall Due Date**

### Wish List
* Back up the file before making any changes  
(Make a copy and rename, then "let the Diva loose.")

### Table of Contents
Not ready yet.

### Notes:
##### Common things required in the project:
* optional curly braces are mandatory - if, else, & any loop
    * block indentation
	    * class body, method body,
		* loop body, if/else,
		* declarations (instance level)
	* spaces around binary operators (just math operators (+ - * / %))
	* brace alignment (religious thing)
	* blank lines between methods and at end of file
	* case checking: class name, method name, constants, variables, formal parameters
		* constants should be all uppercase with underscores separating words
		* variables should be first letter uppercase, the rest lowercase

##### Additional things Code Diva will check for:
* multiple lines of code on one line
* maximum line length

##### 4 test cases to submit for classmates to use:
* 2 programs that will have one error type from each list  
* other programs that will have at least 2 types of errors  
* spaces around binary operators  
* blank lines between methods and eof
