# Project Code Diva

## Objective
**Check the style of java code files.**  
_Does not need to rewrite the code - just needs to point it out in a snooty tone._

**Common things required that the Diva check:**
* Optional curly braces are mandatory - if, else, & any loop
* Block indentation - class body, method body, loop body, if/else, declarations (instance level)
* Spaces around binary operators (just math operators (+ - * / %))
* Brace alignment (religious thing)
* Blank lines between methods and at end of file
* Case checking: class name, method name, constants, variables, formal parameters
	* Constants should be all uppercase with underscores separating words
	* Variables should be first letter uppercase, the rest lowercase  

_One of these can be exempted._

**Additional things the Diva will check for:**
* Multiple lines of code on one line
* Maximum line length

## Time Line
* 07 Sept :: Decide one thing I want to work on as a developer.
* 08 Sept :: Evaluate whether Java is, in fact, feasible to do this in.
* 10 Sept :: Write & post all test cases (_Due by 23:55_).
* 13 Sept :: Determine the structure of the program - _no code yet_.
* 15 Sept :: Get a code skeleton in place with stubs.
* 22 Sept :: Flesh out the stubs in the skeleton.  
* 26 Sept :: **Overall Due Date**

## Wish List
* Make the changes to the code.
    * Back up the file before making any changes  
    (Make a copy and rename, then "let the Diva loose.")

## Table of Contents
Not ready yet.

## Notes on the Test Programs:
Test programs must have one large comment at the top which outlines the errors in the
code file. There should be no other comments.  
All methods should have a visibility keyword (public, private, etc).  
No tabs should be used in test cases - use 3 spaces for indentation.
The program must have 3 test programs not my own for each error.    

Error types assigned to me:
* Optional curly braces
* Blank lines

Total of 6 test cases to submit for classmates to use:
* 2 programs that will have one error type from each list  
* 2 other programs that will have at least 2 types of errors  
* 1 additional test program for each of someone else's personal extra things to check
    * Will need to meet with that person to determine what I need to write for them.

All test programs will be named "yourname_errortype".java as per guidelines that will be on the forums.

## Other Notes:
Pick 6 output of Hana's reports to show Dr. Gurka to showcase the range of what she can do.
