# Project Code Diva

## Objective
**Check the style of java code files.**  
_Does not need to rewrite the code - just needs to point it out in a snooty tone._

**Common things required that the Diva check:**
* optional curly braces are mandatory - if, else, & any loop
* block indentation - class body, method body, loop body, if/else, declarations (instance level)
* spaces around binary operators (just math operators (+ - * / %))
* brace alignment (religious thing)
* blank lines between methods and at end of file
* case checking: class name, method name, constants, variables, formal parameters
	* constants should be all uppercase with underscores separating words
	* variables should be first letter uppercase, the rest lowercase  

_One of these can be exempted_

**Additional things the Diva will check for:**
* multiple lines of code on one line
* maximum line length

## Time Line
* 07 Sept :: Decide one thing I want to work on as a developer.
* 08 Sept :: Evaluate whether Java is, in fact, feasible to do this in.
* 10 Sept :: Write & post all test cases (_Due by 23:55_).
* 13 Sept :: Determine the structure of the program - _no code yet_.
* 15 Sept :: Get a code skeleton in place with stubs.
* 22 Sept :: Flesh out the stubs in the skeleton.  
* 26 Sept :: **Overall Due Date**

## Wish List
* Make the changes to the code.
    * Back up the file before making any changes  
    (Make a copy and rename, then "let the Diva loose.")

## Table of Contents
Not ready yet.

## Notes:
Programs must have one large comment at the top which outlines the errors in the
code file. There should be no other comments.  
All methods should have a visibility keyword (public, private, etc).  
No tabs should be used in test cases - use 3 spaces for indentation.
The program must have 3 test programs not my own for each error.  
Pick 6 output reports to show Dr. Gurka to showcase the range of what the Diva can do.  

Total of 6 test cases to submit for classmates to use:
* 2 programs that will have one error type from each list  
* 2 other programs that will have at least 2 types of errors  
* 1 additional test program for each of someone else's personal extra things to check
    * Will need to meet with that person to determine what I need to write for them.

All test programs will be named "yourname_errortype".java as per guidelines that will be on the forums.
