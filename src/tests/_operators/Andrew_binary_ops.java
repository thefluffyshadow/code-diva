/*
Andrew Hodder
Space around binary operators

On line 22, I put the unary postfix incrementer after of i to attempt to fool the parser. The line should read:

  val = (val * i / 2 + i++) >> 8;

There is also a simpler second error on line 23 where the string is added to val.

    int val = 10;

    for (int i = 0; i < 10;) {
      val = (val*i/2+i++)>>8;  // TODO: Check if the ">>" is actually one of the errors that need to be caught.
      System.out.println("Here is a weird number that has gone through a grinder "+val);
    }
  }
